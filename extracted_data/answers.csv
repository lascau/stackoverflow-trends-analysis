Have you tried to press ctrl + F5, to refresh you browser and clear the cache?

Another problem could be that you are using https in the script tag where you get the libary
 `&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`

while your website might be using http. Its due to moderen browser security, that it isn&#39;t possible.
If that is the case, just change the script sources protocol to http, instead of https.

I can see that you are probaly using asp.net, so you can via IIS create a self signed certificate to run https protocol, instead of http

&lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}&gt;
```

This is a function call, which means this gets called immediatelt the form is created on the DOM, your event listeners need to take a reference to the function which will then get called when the event occurs, to do that you wrap this function call in another anonymous function. Then the function will get called when the submit event occurs. So you need to do this 

```javascript
&lt;form onSubmit={()=&gt;{handleSubmit(onSubmit)}}&gt;
```
Also since this is a submit event, you might want to stop the default behaviour which refreshes the page. Like this


```javascript
&lt;form onSubmit={(ev)=&gt;{
  ev.preventDefault()
  handleSubmit(onSubmit)}}&gt;
``` 
## Update
I did not look at the JSX properly. There are a few things you are probably doing wrong
1. using ref to get input values rather than state
2. when taking in any kind of input you want to convert those fields into control components [Officila docs on controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
I suggest you understand this and state first, that will help you a lot. React docs still uses class components in example code but simply use use state instead of this.state for state varibales

Without that, the variables are unknown inside the script block.

We recommend that you host your source code on github and use Azure Devops for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). This is because Azure DevOps Public Projects aren&#39;t generally discoverable to the general public. A project member needs to publicize the URL for it to be found.

You could use Azure DevOps for free and open-sourced projects. An Azure DevOps Services public project provides support to share code with others and to support continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) of open-source software. Users aren&#39;t required to sign in to gain read-only access to many of the services.

You could refer to this [document][1] to view more detailed information about public project.

Because here from what I can see, I cannot use Azure DevOps in these cases. Is that correct?

Your understanding is correct. The entry of the Code of Conduct is to build a better Azure Devops and let our users get a better experience.

This can compare arrays by arrays in the sort_by method even if the type of the matching items differ. Even if there are deeper nested arrays. Example:

    [ &quot;3  a   22&quot;, &quot;b  22     1&quot;, &quot;   b  5  &quot;, [11, 2, [4, 5]] ] #=&gt;
    [ &quot;3  a   22&quot;, [11, 2, [4, 5]], &quot;   b  5  &quot;, &quot;b  22     1&quot; ]

The point here is that during the sort if an item is a nested array then we convert it to a string beforehand. And if parts of the string contain digits only then we do not convert them to numeric values but instead extend them with spaces, like:

    30 #=&gt; &quot;                         30&quot;

This way all objects will be compatible strings and the sorting will be able to compare them resulting in a numeric sort if the matching objects at their positions are numbers only.",2020-11-16 11:31:30

36,"Instead of filtering the collection in your template, you can use the [configuration API to create a filtered collection][1] in your `.eleventy.js` file. This should work:

If you need both both the filtered list of posts as well as the complete list, you can also use different aliases:

One method to do this is by simply adding another trace, you were nearly there!

**Note:**  
The following code uses the &#39;lower-level&#39; plotly API, as (personally) I feel it&#39;s more transparent and enables the user to see what is being plotted, and why; rather than relying on the convenience modules of `graph_objects` and `express`.

### Option 1 - Overlaid Bars:

    from plotly.offline import plot
    
    layout = {}
    traces = []
    
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: data1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D1&#39;, &#39;opacity&#39;: 1.0})
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: data2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D2&#39;, &#39;opacity&#39;: 0.5})
    
    # For each trace, add elements which are common to both.
    for t in traces:
        t.update({&#39;type&#39;: &#39;histogram&#39;,
                  &#39;histfunc&#39;: &#39;count&#39;,
                  &#39;nbinsx&#39;: 50})
    
    layout[&#39;barmode&#39;] = &#39;overlay&#39;
    
    plot({&#39;data&#39;: traces, &#39;layout&#39;: layout})

### Output 1:
[![enter image description here][1]][1]

### Option 2 - Curve Plot:  
Another option is to plot the curve (Gaussian KDE) of the distribution, as shown here. It&#39;s worth noting that this method plots the probability density, rather than the counts.

    X1, Y1 = calc_curve(data1)
    X2, Y2 = calc_curve(data2)
    
    traces = []
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: X1, &#39;y&#39;: Y1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D1&#39;})
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: X2, &#39;y&#39;: Y2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D2&#39;})
    
    plot({&#39;data&#39;: traces})

### Output 2:
[![enter image description here][2]][2]


Associated `calc_curve` function:

    from scipy.stats import gaussian_kde

    def calc_curve(data):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Calculate probability density.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        min_, max_ = data.min(), data.max()
        X = [min_ + i * ((max_ - min_) / 500) for i in range(501)]
        Y = gaussian_kde(data).evaluate(X)
        return(X, Y)

### Option 3 - Plot Bars and Curves:
Or, you can always combine the two methods together, using the probability density on the yaxis.

    layout = {}
    traces = []
    
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: data1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D1&#39;, &#39;opacity&#39;: 1.0})
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: data2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D2&#39;, &#39;opacity&#39;: 0.5})
    
    for t in traces:
        t.update({&#39;type&#39;: &#39;histogram&#39;,
                  &#39;histnorm&#39;: &#39;probability density&#39;,
                  &#39;nbinsx&#39;: 50})
    
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: X1, &#39;y&#39;: Y1, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D1&#39;})
    traces.append({&#39;x&#39;: X2, &#39;y&#39;: Y2, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;D2&#39;})
    
    layout[&#39;barmode&#39;] = &#39;overlay&#39;
    
    plot({&#39;data&#39;: traces, &#39;layout&#39;: layout})

44,"@maytham The solution by Maytham will work well. However, it will have a huge problem if you&#39;re trying to do with large data. Even if you do 1000 rows, it will create a problem, as it will make 1000 insert statement separately. I will just edit the third method by him and add my own input

This will call the database once to insert as many rows as you wish. Be it 1000, 100000 or whatever. 
*However, if you have a huge csv, this will be a problem too since you will be required to insert in chunks.

45,"&lt;sup&gt;I really wanted to find a use for pointer-to-member syntax for once, so...&lt;/sup&gt;

You can use pointer-to-member syntax with a set of overloaded helpers to let compiler choose the correct convertor:

```
struct Record
{
    int x;
    std::string y;
    double z;
    
    void readInput(std::istream&amp; in, int Record::*var)
    {
        std::string input;
        std::getline(in, input, &#39;|&#39;);
        this-&gt;*var = std::stoi(input);
    }
    
    void readInput(std::istream&amp; in, double Record::*var)
    {
        std::string input;
        std::getline(in, input, &#39;|&#39;);
        this-&gt;*var = std::stod(input);
    }
    
    void readInput(std::istream&amp; in, std::string Record::*var)
    {
        std::getline(in, this-&gt;*var, &#39;|&#39;);
    }
};
```

With this, the `operator &gt;&gt;` would look like this:
```
std::istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(std::istream&amp; in, Record&amp; r)
{
    r.readInput(in, &amp;Record::x);
    r.readInput(in, &amp;Record::y);
    r.readInput(in, &amp;Record::z);
    //no need to handle last value as special case as long as stream ends there and you don&#39;t care that it will be in fail() state afterwards
    return in;
}
```
[See it online](https://wandbox.org/permlink/7BAWI6UNC50LyXuT)

----------


It would be possible to just provide free functions, which take a reference instead of pointer to member, e.g.:
```
void readInput(std::istream&amp; in, int&amp; var)
{
    std::string input;
    std::getline(in, input, &#39;|&#39;);
    var = std::stoi(input);
}
```

with usage in `operator &gt;&gt;` like this:

    readInput(in, r.x);

54,"Well. I have met this question 2 days ago. And since performed research about this matter. I was looking for a solution that would allow me to be able to run application with different profiles passed as a system property on the application run like:

    java -Denv=local-dev-env -jar java-app.jar

The only appropriate solution I was able to find is to follow the oficial documentation testing guide:
https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/testing 
and devide my one module into different modules, in particular I had to separate and substitute data base dependency when I want to run my app locally avoiding connection to real DB and executing any command against real DB. 
And when I run my app I perform check on system property like:

    public boolean isLocalDevEnv() {
    		return Environments.LOCAL_DEV.envName.equals(System.getProperty(&quot;env&quot;, Environments.PRODUCTION.envName));
    	}

and if the system property DOES NOT contain the property I am looking for, then I 
create the PRODUCTION instance of my component (that is configured to use production modules):

    DaggerMyAppComponent.create()

Which approximately looks like:

    @Component(modules = {MyAppModule.class, DaoModule.class})
    @Singleton
    public interface MyAppComponent {...}
    
otherwise, I create loca-dev-env version of the component that uses the version of the module that produces mock of Dao that would be creating real connection to real Data Base otherwise:

    DaggerMyAppLocalDevEnvComponent.create()

Which approximately looks like:

    @Component(modules = {MyAppModule.class, DaoMockModule.class})
    @Singleton
    public interface MyAppLocalDevEnvComponent {...}

Hope it was clear, so just think of Spring Profiles for dagger 2 from the perspective of system properties and programmatic decision making. This approach definitely requires ALOT of boilerplate code in comparison to Spring&#39;s Profiles implementation, but it is the only viable approach I was able to come up with.

Hope it helps.

55,"What you are looking for is simple [inheritence][1].
You describe the features you need in a base class and mark them (and the class) [abstract][2]. This enforces you to override it in all non abstract derived classed.

Base class:

    public abstract class BaseUnit : MonoBehaviour
    {
        protected abstract float movementSpeed { get; } // force every deriving class to provide a movement speed
        [SerializeField] private bool isMoving;

        void Start()
        {
            isMoving = true;
        }

        void Update()
        {
            if (isMoving)
            {
                Movement();
            }

        }

        public void Movement()
        {
            Vector3 direction = new Vector3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
            transform.position += Time.deltaTime * movementSpeed * direction;

        }
    }


Derived class Archer: 

    public class Archer : BaseUnit
    {
        protected override float movementSpeed =&gt; 3F;
    }

Also note that you cannot create `MonoBehaviours` using the `new` keyword. You have to use `AddComponent&lt;T&gt;` to create or `GetComponent&lt;T&gt;` to retrieve them ([see documentation][3]).

56,"&gt; How is this possible?

You are using `TO_CHAR` on a date data type to convert it to a string data type and then the filter is: 

```
{string value} BETWEEN {string value} AND {string value}
```

So the SQL parser performs an alpha-numeric comparison of the values and the lower bound starts `22` and `23.06.2014` is greater as the first characters of the string are the same and then the second character is compared and `2` &lt; `3` so `&#39;22.10.2015 23:59:59&#39;` &lt; `&#39;23.06.2014&#39;` when compared as a string. Similarly, the upper bound starts with `23.1` and the first 3 characters are the same and then `0` &lt; `1` for the 4th character so `&#39;23.06.2014&#39;` &lt; `&#39;23.10.2015 23:59:59&#39;` (again, when compared as a string). So the filter returns true as the string value is between the upper and lower bounds.

How to solve this:

Don&#39;t compare the values as strings; compare them as dates.

``` sql
AND ses_date BETWEEN DATE &#39;2015-10-22&#39; + INTERVAL &#39;23:59:59&#39; HOUR TO SECOND
             AND     DATE &#39;2015-10-23&#39; + INTERVAL &#39;23:59:59&#39; HOUR TO SECOND
```

or

``` sql
AND ses_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP &#39;2015-10-22 23:59:59&#39;
             AND     TIMESTAMP &#39;2015-10-23 23:59:59&#39;
```

or

``` sql
AND ses_date BETWEEN TO_DATE( &#39;22.10.2015 23:59:59&#39;, &#39;DD.MM.YYYY HH24:MI:SS&#39; )
             AND     TO_DATE( &#39;23.10.2015 23:59:59&#39;, &#39;DD.MM.YYYY HH24:MI:SS&#39; )
```

*(Note: these will return values from including `2015-10-22 23:59:59`.)*

If you only want values that are at any time on `2015-10-23` then:

``` sql
AND ses_date &gt;= DATE &#39;2015-10-23&#39;
AND ses_date &lt;  DATE &#39;2015-10-24&#39;

It doesn&#39;t know about the child part. It doesn&#39;t matter if a Parent object is declared as a stand-alone object or as a member of Child, same thing applies in either case.

&gt; How does type casting work here?

Poorly... you have implemented inheritance incorrectly if you have to cast to the base class from the caller side. It would seem that `Child` should have implemented its own `move` that takes a `Child*` as parameter, if only to make it a wrapper to the parent.

75,"You could do this in XAML using a [`MultiBinding`][1] and a [converter][2]. A multi binding allows you to bind multiple values and convert it to a single value for the target property. In your case, you would bind the three enabled state properties and and do a boolean AND as conversion.

The following multi-value converter returns `true`, if all passed values are `true`, otherwise `false`.

```
public class BooleanAndConverter : IMultiValueConverter
{
   public object Convert(object[] values, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
   {
      return values.Cast&lt;bool&gt;().All(value =&gt; value);
   }

   public object[] ConvertBack(object value, Type[] targetTypes, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
   {
      throw new InvalidOperationException();
   }
}
```

In your XAML, you would bind the `IsEnabled` property for button A like this:

```
&lt;Button 
   x:Name=&quot;Button_A&quot;
   Click=&quot;Button_A_Click&quot;
   Content=&quot;Run&quot;
   HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
   VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;
   Width=&quot;80&quot;
   Height=&quot;25&quot;
   Margin=&quot;135,0,0,0&quot;
   FontSize=&quot;10&quot;
   FontWeight=&quot;Light&quot;
   Background=&quot;{StaticResource CalculationsButtonColor}&quot;
   BorderBrush=&quot;{StaticResource CalculationsButtonColor}&quot;
   Grid.Column=&quot;3&quot;
   Grid.Row=&quot;4&quot;
   Cursor=&quot;Hand&quot;&gt;
   &lt;Button.IsEnabled&gt;
      &lt;MultiBinding&gt;
         &lt;MultiBinding.Converter&gt;
            &lt;local:BooleanAndConverter/&gt;
         &lt;/MultiBinding.Converter&gt;
         &lt;Binding Path=&quot;EnableButtonB&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;Binding Path=&quot;EnableButtonC&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;Binding Path=&quot;EnableButtonD&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;
   &lt;/Button.IsEnabled&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
```

You could also bind the the `IsEnabled` properties of the other buttons directly, e.g:

```
&lt;Binding Path=&quot;IsEnabled&quot; ElementName=&quot;Button_B&quot;/&gt;
```

By the way, you could do the same using a `MultiDataTrigger`, but that would require creating a separate button style, which is more verbose and unnecessary.
