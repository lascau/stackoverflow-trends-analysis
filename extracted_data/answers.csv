1,"To fix this issue, you have 2 options: 

1- (**Recommended**) To add the scopes to API resource like this: 

```
public static IEnumerable&lt;ApiResource&gt; GetApis() =&gt;
            new List&lt;ApiResource&gt; {
                new ApiResource(&quot;api1&quot;)
                {
                    Scopes = new []{ &quot;api1&quot; }
                }
            };

        public static IEnumerable&lt;ApiScope&gt; GetApiScopes()
        {
            return new List&lt;ApiScope&gt;
            {
                // backward compat
                new ApiScope(&quot;api1&quot;)
            };
        }

```

2- On API change your code to set `ValidateAudience = false`, like this: 
```
services.AddAuthentication(&quot;Bearer&quot;).AddJwtBearer(&quot;Bearer&quot;,
   options =&gt;
   {
      options.Authority = &quot;http://localhost:5000&quot;;
      options.Audience = &quot;api1&quot;;
      options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
      options.TokenValidationParameters = new 
         TokenValidationParameters()
         {
            ValidateAudience = false
         };
   });
```

5,"Turns out this wasn&#39;t an issue with CORS at all!
It was to do with the file size of the image I was uploading

nginx servers have a default `client_max_body_size` of 1MB, meaning any upload of &gt;1MB image would be rejected. Adding `client_max_body_size 100M;` to my nginx config fixed this.

Safari error was of course super misleading so I didn&#39;t even think of checking the nginx logs. It explains why the django server wasn&#39;t even logging the `/upload` request.

Another error I made on my part was not uploading the same sized image on Chrome, Firefox as it should have failed too. I just used the first thing I saw when clicking upload and seems Safari was by default pointed to a folder where images were large, and the other browsers were pointed to my Downloads where the first images were smaller",2020-11-16 00:27:07
6,"One of the main drawbacks in your scenario would be the complexity of the system - which means higher development (including this research phase) &amp; maintenance costs. That is especially important in early stages of a project. Typically, you would focus on the main business functionality and leave such optimizations for later, when you see the business value in investing in such relatively small optimizations (i.e. you need a LOT of traffic to get back the initial costs + additional maintenance costs).

If you see the business case in looking into this further, you should start with estimating the actual benefit. So you should check out some benchmarks - e.g. how fast could you get the writes on Redis vs. DynamoDB (optimized for this use case)?

Next, if you expect to constantly have a TON of traffic - does the math say serverless is actually better for you? Maybe it&#39;s more cost effective to just have auto-scaled instances up and running with local in-memory cache, which gets dumped to DB in chunks (instead of using Redis of the same idea)? Serverless is not always as cost-efficient as the nice adverts show.

As you noted, consistency is a very important aspect to think about. Do you really need it? What happens if, e.g., two lamdbas want to update the same &#39;card&#39;? Ideally, you should not care which update is handled first. If they could happen in any order (without an error) - that would give you the most options for getting better performance &amp; lower costs.",2020-11-16 00:27:02

# TL;DR

**`Google ARCore`** allows you build apps for Android and iOS/iPadOS. With **`Apple ARKit`** you can build apps for iOS and iPadOS only. And a great old **`PTC Vuforia`** was designed to create apps for Android, iOS/iPadOS and Universal Windows Platform. 

**A crucial Vuforia&#39;s peculiarity is that it uses `ARCore`/`ARKit` technology if the hardware it&#39;s running on supports it, otherwise Vuforia uses its own AR technology and engine, known as `software solution without dependant hardware`**.

&gt;When developing for Android OEM smartphones, you may encounter with an unpleasant problem: devices from different manufacturers need a sensors’ calibration in order to observe the same AR experience. Luckily, Apple gadgets have no such drawback because all sensors used there were calibrated under identical conditions.   

To answer this question, let’s put first things first.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

# **Google ARCore 1.21** 

ARCore is based on the three main [fundamental concepts][3] : **`Motion Tracking`**, **`Environmental Understanding`** and **`Light Estimation`**. Thus ARCore allows a [supported mobile device][4] to track its position and orientation relative to the world in 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) using special technique called **Concurrent Odometry and Mapping**. COM also helps us detect the size and location of horizontal, vertical and angled tracked surfaces (like ground, tables, benches, walls, slopes, etc). Motion Tracking works robustly thanks to optical data coming from a camera **at 60 fps**, combined with inertial data coming from gyroscope and accelerometer **at 1000 fps**. Naturally, ARKit and Vuforia operate almost the same way.

  When you move your phone through the real environment, ARCore tracks a surrounding space to understand where a smartphone is, relative to the world coordinates. At tracking stage ARCore &quot;***sows***&quot; so called **`feature points`** which form a sparse [point cloud][5] and this cloud lives while tracking session is active. These feature points are visible through RGB camera, and ARCore uses them to compute phone&#39;s change in location. The visual data then must be combined with measurements coming from accelerometer and gyroscope (**Inertial Measurement Unit**) to estimate the position and orientation of the [ArCamera][6] over time. ARCore looks for clusters of feature points that appear to lie on horizontal, vertical or angled surfaces and makes these surfaces available to your app as planes (we call this technique as **plane detection**). So, now you can use these planes to place 3D objects in your scene. After this, virtual geometry with assigned shaders will be rendered by ARCore&#39;s companion – **Sceneform**, supporting `OBJ`, `FBX` and `glTF` assets and using a real-time **Physically Based Rendering** (a.k.a. PBR) engine – [Filament][7]. 

Notwithstanding the above, at this moment Sceneform repository has been archived and it no longer actively maintaining by Google. The last released version was Sceneform 1.17.0.

 ARCore&#39;s environmental understanding lets you place 3D objects and 2D annotations in a way that integrates with the real world. For example, you can place a virtual cup of coffee on the corner of your real-world table using **ArAnchor**.

 ARCore can also define lighting parameters of a real environment and provide you with the average intensity and color correction of a given camera image. This data lets you light your virtual scene under the same conditions as the environment around you, considerably increasing the sense of realism.  

Current ARCore version has such a significant APIs as [Depth API][8], `Lighting Estimation` with `Environmental HDR mode`, `Augmented Faces`, `Augmented Images`, `Instant Placement`, `Sceneform Animations`, [365-days Cloud Anchors][9], `Recording and Playback` and `Multiplayer support`. The main advantage of ARCore in Android Studio over ARKit in Xcode is [Android Emulator][10] allowing you run and debug AR apps using virtual device.  

ARCore is older than ARKit. Do you remember Project Tango released in 2014? Roughly speaking, ARCore is just a rewritten Tango SDK without a depth camera support. But a wise acquisition of FlyBy and MetaIO helped Apple not only to catch up but also significantly overtake. I suppose it is extremely good for AR industry. 

The latest version of ARCore requires Android 7.0 Nougat or later, supports OpenGL ES 3.1 acceleration, and integrates with Unity, Unreal, and Web applications. At the moment the most powerful and energy efficient chipsets for AR experience on Android platform are **Snapdragon 875** (5nm), **Exynos 1080** (5nm) and **Kirin 980** (7nm).

# **Apple ARKit 4.0**

ARKit was released in June 2017 and just two years later it became very popular. Like its competitors, ARKit also uses special technique, called **Visual Inertial Odometry**, to very accurately track the world around your device. VIO is quite similar to COM found in ARCore. There are also three similar fundamental concepts in ARKit: **`World Tracking`**, **`Scene Understanding`** (which includes four stages: **Plane Detection**, **Hit-Testing** / **Ray-Casting**, **Light Estimation**, **[Scene Reconstruction][13]**), and **`Rendering`** with a great help of ARKit companions – **[SceneKit][14]** framework, that’s actually an Apple 3D game engine since 2012, **RealityKit** framework specially made for AR and written in Swift from scratch (released in 2019), and **SpriteKit** framework with its 2D engine (since 2013).

VIO fuses RGB sensor data **at 60 fps** with Core-Motion data (IMU) **at 1000 fps**. In addition to that, SceneKit, for example, can render all the 3D geometry at 30/60/120 fps. So, under such circumstances, I think it should be noted that due to a very high energy impact (because of an enormous burden on CPU and GPU), your iPhone&#39;s battery will be drained pretty quickly.

ARKit has a handful of useful methods for robust tracking and accurate measurements. Among its arsenal you can find easy-to-use functionality for saving and retrieving **ARWorldMaps**. World map is an indispensable &quot;portal&quot; for ***Persistent*** and ***Multiuser AR experience*** that allows you to come back to the same environment filled with the same chosen 3D content just before the moment your app became inactive. Support for simultaneous `front` and `back` camera capture and support for `collaborative sessions` that allows us to share World Maps are also great.

There are good news for gamers: up to 6 people are simultaneously able to play the same AR game, thanks to [MultipeerConnectivity][15] framework. For 3D geometry you could use a brand-new [USDZ][16] file format, developed and supported by Pixar, that is good choice for sophisticated 3D models with lots of PBR shaders and animations. Also you can use the [following 3D formats][17] for ARKit.

ARKit not only can help you track a position and orientation of your device relative to the world in 6 DOF, but also help you perform [People and Objects Occlusion][18] technique (based on **alpha** and **depth** channels&#39; segmentation), `LiDAR Scene Reconstruction`, `Body Motion Capture tracking`, `2D tracking`, `Vertical and Horizontal Planes detection`, `Image detection`, `3D Object detection` and `3D Object scanning`. With People and Objects Occlusion tool your AR content realistically passes behind and in front of real world entities, making AR experiences even more immersive. Also, `Realistic reflections`, that use machine learning algorithms and `Face-based AR experience` that allows to track up to 3 faces at a time are available for you.  

Using iBeacons along with ARKit, you assist an iBeacon-aware application to know what room it’s in, and show the correct 3D/2D content chosen for that room. Working with ARKit you should intensively exploit [ARAnchor][19] class and all its subclasses, the same way you’ve been using it in ARCore.  

Pay particular attention to RealityKit&#39;s satellite – **`Reality Composer`** application that&#39;s now a part of Xcode. This brand-new app helps you build 3D scenes for AR. Scenes built in Reality Composer can be packed with dynamics, simple animations and PBR materials. Reality Composer can be installed on iOS and iPadOS as a standalone app.

For creating AR apps built on the latest versions of ARKit 4.0, including brand-new LiDAR scanner support, you need macOS 11 Big Sur, Xcode 12 and device running iOS 14 or iPadOS 14. **A sad news is – all ARKit 4.0 top features are restricted to devices powered by Apple A12 chipset and higher**. Also ARKit 4.0 is a worthy candidate to marry Metal framework for GPU acceleration. Don’t forget that ARKit tightly integrates with Unity and Unreal. At the moment the most powerful and energy efficient chipsets for AR experience are **A14 Bionic** (5nm), **A13 Bionic** (7nm) and **A12z Bionic** (7nm).

# **Apple RealityKit 2.0**

You should carefully look at [RealityKit][22] that was introduced in WWDC 2019. There’s been a lot of hype around it since then. RealityKit allows you create AR experiences for iOS/iPadOS and VR experiences for mobiles and macOS. This high-level framework works with `.usdz` assets as well as with `.rcproject` and `.reality` file formats which you can import from standalone macOS or iOS app – [Reality Composer][23] (RC). Cupertino software engineers built RealityKit from the ground for augmented reality apps that you can create with no repetitive code. It works with Swift from scratch – there’s no Objective-C legacy. And, of course, RealityKit shines not only with SwiftUI and UIKit but with Metal too.

RealityKit framework has several fundamental blocks on which RealityKit&#39;s scenes are based: a parent class **Entity**, a class **[AnchorEntity][24]** that automatically tracks target (unlike in ARKit), classes **BodyTrackedEntity**, **ModelEntity**, **PointLight**, **SpotLight**, **DirectionalLight**, **TriggerVolume** and **PerspectiveCamera**. These entities are just like SceneKit&#39;s nodes but slightly different in hierarchical structure. And, of course, most entities have [Components][25]. It would be useful to say that ModelEntity is built on [MeshResource][26] and [Materials][27] and now there&#39;s a support for [VideoMaterial][28] in RealityKit 2.0.

[![enter image description here][29]][29]

**RealityKit** framework gives you a rich set of building blocks to work with AR and VR: new declarative Swift syntax, 3D primitives (at the moment `box`, `plane`, `sphere` and `text`), PBR materials with textures, occlusion material and video material, [lighting fixtures][30] (`directional`, `spot` and `point`) with realistic ray-traced shadows, spacial audio processing, different anchors types (`body`, `camera`, `face`, `image`, `object`, `horizontal plane`, `vertical plane`, `raycastResult`, `ARAnchor` and `world`), simplified setup for collaborative sessions, robust animations&#39; and physics&#39; setup, indispensable AI and ML built-in features and many other useful things.

**Reality Composer** application gives you a simple and intuitive UI for constructing 3D scenes for Augmented Reality experiences. It has a royalty free library with downloadable 3D assets that allow you construct sophisticated 3D scenes with animation, audio, and dynamics which contain a thorough description of how these objects behave. You can also export your composition as a lightweight [AR Quick Look][31] experience that lets users place and preview a content. In Reality Composer app you can start your project using one of five anchor types: `horizontal`, `vertical`, `image`, `face` and `object` – which corresponds to desired type of tracking.

**RealityKit and Reality Composer price: FREE**.

    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    let textAnchor = try! SomeText.loadTextScene()
    let textEntity: Entity = textAnchor.realityComposer!.children[0]
    var textMC: ModelComponent = textEntity.children[0].components[ModelComponent]!
    
    var material = SimpleMaterial()
    material.baseColor = .color(.yellow)
    textMC.materials[0] = material
    textMC.mesh = .generateText(&quot;Hello, RealityKit&quot;)
    textAnchor.realityComposer!.children[0].children[0].components.set(textMC)
    arView.scene.anchors.append(textAnchor)
}
```

One more important part of Apple&#39;s AR ecosystem is `Reality Converter` app. Now, instead of using a command line conversion tool, you can use a [Reality Converter][33]. The brand-new app makes it easy for you to convert, view and customize `.usdz` 3D objects on Mac. Simply drag-and-drop common 3D file formats, such as `.obj`, `.gltf` or `.usd`, to view the converted `.usdz` result, customize material properties with your own textures and edit file metadata. You can even preview your `.usdz` object under a variety of lighting and environment conditions with built-in Image-Based Lighting (IBL) options.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

# **PTC Vuforia 9.5**

In October 2015 PTC acquired Vuforia from Qualcomm for $65 million. Take into consideration that Qualcomm launched Vuforia in 2010. So Vuforia is an older sister in AR family. Big sister is watching you, guys! ;)

In November 2016 Unity Technologies and PTC announced a strategic collaboration to simplify AR development. Since then they work together integrating new features of the Vuforia AR platform into the Unity game engine. Vuforia can be used with such development environments as Unity, MS Visual Studio, Apple Xcode and Android Studio. It supports a wide range of smartphones, tablets and AR smart glasses, such as HoloLens, Magic Leap, Vuzix M400, and ODG R7.

Vuforia Engine boasts approximately the same main capabilities that you can find in the latest versions of ARKit but also it has its own features, such as Model Targets with Deep Learning, VISLAM for markerless AR experience and External Camera support for iOS, new experimental APIs for ARCore and ARKit and support for industry latest AR glasses. The main advantage of Vuforia over ARKit and ARCore that it has a [wider list of supported devices][36] and it supports the development of [Universal Windows Platform][37] apps for Intel-based Windows 10 devices, including Microsoft Surface and HoloLens.

Vuforia has a standalone version and a version baked directly into Unity. It has the following functionality: 

- **Advanced Model Targets 360**, recognition powered by AI;
- **Model Targets with Deep Learning**, allow to instantly recognize objects by shape using pre-existing 3D models and deep learning algorithms;
- **Image Targets**, the easiest way to put AR content on flat objects;
- **Multi Targets**, for objects with flat surfaces and multiple sides; 
- **Cylinder Targets**, for placing AR content on objects with cylindrical shapes, like bottles; 
- **Ground Plane**, as a part of `Smart Terrain`, this feature enables digital content to be placed on floors and tabletop surfaces;
- **VuMarks**, allows identify and add content to series of objects; 
- **Object Targets**, for scanning an object;
- **Static and Adaptive Modes**, for stationary and moving objects;
- **Simulation Play Mode**, allows developers to “walk through” or around the 3D model and see the final AR experience from their computer;
- **Vuforia Area Target Creator** app, enables us to scan and generate new Area Targets by using a depth-enabled mobile devices;
- **AR Session Recorder**, can record AR experiences in the location, and then use that recording with Playback mode in Unity for editing and updating;
- and, of course, **Vuforia Fusion** and **Vuforia Engine Area Targets**. 

**Vuforia Fusion** is a capability designed to solve the problem of fragmentation in AR enabling technologies such as cameras, sensors, chipsets, and software frameworks like ARKit. With Vuforia Fusion, your application will automatically provide the best experience possible with no extra work required on your end.

**Vuforia Engine Area Targets** enable developers to use an entire space, be it a factory floor or retail store, as an augmented reality target. Using a first supported device, a `Matterport Pro2` camera, developers can create a detailed 3D scan of a desired location. Locations are recommended to be indoors, mostly static, and no larger than 1,000 sqm (around 10,000 sqft). Once the scan produces a 3D model it can be converted into an Area Target with the Vuforia Area Target Generator. This target can then be brought into Unity where content can be placed within a digital representation of the space.

Vuforia API allows for a `Static` or `Adaptive` mode. When the real-world model remains stationary, like a large industrial machine, implementing the `Static` API will use significantly less processing power. This enables a longer lasting and higher performance experience for those models. For objects that won’t be stationary the `Adaptive` API allows for a continued robust experience.

The **`External Camera`** feature is a part of the Vuforia Engine Driver Framework. External Camera provides a new perspective on what’s possible with Augmented Reality. It allows Vuforia Engine to access external video sources beyond the camera equipped in phones and tablets. By using an independent camera, developers can create an AR experience that offers a first-person view from toys, robots or industrial tools. 

**`Occlusion Management`** is one of the key features for building a realistic AR experience. When you&#39;re using Occlusion Management, Vuforia Engine detects and tracks targets, even when they’re partially hidden behind everyday barriers, like your hand. Special occlusion handling allows apps to display graphics as if they appear inside physical objects.

Vuforia supports Metal acceleration for iOS devices. Also you can use Vuforia Samples for your projects. For example: the `Vuforia Core Samples` library includes various scenes using Vuforia features, including a pre-configured Object Recognition scene that you can use as a reference and starting point for Object Recognition application.

*Here&#39;s AR Foundation code&#39;s snippet written in C#:*

``` lang-csharp
private void UpdatePlacementPose() {

    var screenCenter = Camera.main.ViewportToScreenPoint(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f));
    var hits = new List&lt;ARRaycastHit&gt;();
    arOrigin.Raycast(screenCenter, hits, TrackableType.Planes);
    
    placementPoseIsValid = hits.Count &gt; 0;

    if (placementPoseIsValid) {

        placementPose = hits[0].pose;
    
        var cameraForward = Camera.current.transform.forward;
        var cameraBearing = new Vector3(cameraForward.x, 
                                        0, 
                                        cameraForward.z).normalized;

        placementPose.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(cameraBearing);
    }
}
```

**Vuforia SDK Pricing Options**: 

- **Free license** – you just need to register for a free [Development License Key][39]

- **Basic license** (*$42/month, billed annually*) – For Students
  
- **Basic + Cloud license** (*$99/month*) – For Small Businesses

- **Pro license** (*personal price*) – For All Companies Types

Here are Pros and Cons.

&gt;**CONCLUSION** :
&gt;
&gt;There are no significant limitations when developing with PTC Vuforia 9.5 compared to ARCore 1.21 and ARKit 4.0. Vuforia is an old great product and it supports a wider list of Apple and Android devices that are not officially supported and, of course, it supports several latest models of AR glasses. 
&gt;
&gt;But in my opinion, ARKit 4.0 with a **Reality Family** toolkit (RealityKit, Reality Composer and Reality Converter) have an extra bunch of useful up-to-date features that Vuforia 9.5 and ARCore 1.21 just partially have. ARKit 4.0 personally has a much greater, if not saying astonishing, short-distance measurement accuracy than ARCore compatible device has, within a room or on a street, without any need for calibration. This is achieved through the use of Apple LiDAR scanner. ARCore 1.21 uses iToF cameras and `Depth API`, and Vuforia 9.5 adds `Occlusion Management` feature to a whole picture. That allows you create a high-quality virtual mesh with `OcclusionMaterial` for real-world surfaces at scene understanding stage. This mesh is ready-for-collision and ready-to-be-lit. ARKit 4.0 now instantly detects nonplanar surfaces and surfaces with no-features-at-all, such as texture-free white walls in a poorly-lit rooms. 
&gt;
&gt;Also if you implement iBeacon tools, WorldMaps, and support for GPS – it will help you eliminate any tracking errors accumulated over time. And ARKit&#39;s tight integration with Vision and CoreML frameworks makes a huge contribution to a robust AR toolset. Integration with Apple Maps allows ARKit 4.0 to put `GPS Location Anchors` outdoors with a highest possible precision at the moment.
&gt;
&gt;Vuforia&#39;s measurement accuracy greatly depends on what platform you&#39;re developing for. Pay particular attention to the fact that even popular [Vuforia Chalk][41] application was built on Apple ARKit. This makes sense, doesn&#39;t it?

Providing such functionality therefore requires third-party code.  

In your case, it seems your script requires the [`XmlRpc` module](https://github.com/lipkau/XmlRpc/blob/master/XmlRpc.psd1), available from the PowerShell Gallery [here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/XmlRpc) (which means you can install it with `Install-Module XmlRpc`).

However, this module was last updated more than 5 years ago, predating PowerShell&#39;s cross-platform edition, [PowerShell (Core)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), so you&#39;ll have to find out yourself if it works on a Unix-like platform such as Ubuntu.

So no matter how long your array is, the space usage is constant. 

However, your question alone may be meaningful, but in this program, it does not matter. We all know for an algorithm, the big-O for space and time is determined by the largest part of the algorithm. You actually other operations in your code that has O(N) space operation. For example, `reversed()` function generates a whole new list.

55,"Before I answer the question, I need to say two things: first, I couldn&#39;t understand so much about your styled-components code, so I&#39;ll just transform your react/CSS code to react-typescript/styled-component. Second, I didn&#39;t get what you mean by &quot;difficulties when label size varies&quot;, so I&#39;m not focusing on this in the answer. That been said, let&#39;s go to the code.

Input.tsx
---------
```react
import React from &#39;react&#39;;
import styled from &#39;styled-components&#39;;

interface InputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;{
    id: string;
    label: string;
}

const InputGroup = styled.div`
  position: relative;
`;

const InputLabel = styled.label`
  color: #8d8d8d;
  position: absolute;
  top: 27px;
  left: 55px;
  background: #ffffff;
  transition: 300ms;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
`;

const InputField = styled.input`
  outline: none;
  padding: 16px 22px;
  border: 1px solid #dadce0;
  font-size: 18px;
  border-radius: 5px;

  &amp;:focus
  {
    border: 2px solid royalblue;
  }

  &amp;:valid + ${InputLabel}
  {
    top: -1px;
    padding: 0 3px;
    font-size:14px;
    color: #8d8d8d;
  }

  &amp;:focus + ${InputLabel}
  {
    top: -1px;
    padding: 0 3px;
    font-size:14px;
    color: royalblue;
    transition: 300ms;
  }
`;

const Input: React.FC&lt;InputProps&gt; = ({ id, label, ...rest }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;InputGroup&gt;
      &lt;InputField id={id} {...rest} /&gt;
      &lt;InputLabel htmlFor={id} &gt;{label}&lt;/InputLabel&gt;
    &lt;/InputGroup&gt;
  );
}

export default Input;

```

The idea here is to create an input component that already has a label inside it. Initially, I create an interface called _InputProps_ which extends all attributes from a common InputElement and forces the parent component to put an _id_ and a _label_ attribute.

Them I used styled-components to copy all styles from the youtube guy. To put pseudo-classes on styled-components you have to use a sass&#39; feature called [parent selector][1]. Using the ampersand, you can refer to the parent selector. Another thing you have to use is [styled-components reference][2]. This feature will allow you to refer to the styled-label in the code.

Now that you&#39;ve created the Input component, let&#39;s use it on the App.


App.tsx
---------
```react
import React from &#39;react&#39;;
import Input from &#39;./Input&#39;;

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Input required type=&quot;text&quot; label=&quot;First Name&quot; id=&quot;first-name&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;Input required type=&quot;text&quot; label=&quot;Hello&quot; id=&quot;hello&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}

export default App;

```

58,"Your first mistake is thinking that ASCII encoding and Base64 encoding are interchangeable. They are not. They are used for different purposes.

 * When you encode text in ASCII, you start with a text string and convert it to a sequence of bytes.
 * When you encode data in Base64, you start with a sequence of bytes and convert it to a text string. 

To understand why Base64 was necessary in the first place we need a little history of computing.

---

Computers communicate in binary - 0s and 1s - but people typically want to communicate with more rich forms data such as text or images. In order to transfer this data between computers it first has to be encoded into 0s and 1s, sent, then decoded again. To take text as an example - there are many different ways to perform this encoding. It would be much simpler if we could all agree on a single encoding, but sadly this is not the case.

Originally a lot of different encodings were created (e.g. [Baudot code][3]) which used a different number of bits per character until eventually ASCII became a standard with 7 bits per character. However most computers store binary data in bytes consisting of 8 bits each so [ASCII][2] is unsuitable for tranferring this type of data. Some systems would even wipe the most significant bit. Furthermore the difference in line ending encodings across systems mean that the ASCII character 10 and 13 were also sometimes modified.

To solve these problems [Base64][1] encoding was introduced. This allows you to encode arbitrary bytes to bytes which are known to be safe to send without getting corrupted (ASCII alphanumeric characters and a couple of symbols). The disadvantage is that encoding the message using Base64 increases its length - every 3 bytes of data is encoded to 4 ASCII characters.

To send text reliably you can **first** encode to bytes using a text encoding of your choice (for example UTF-8) and then **afterwards** Base64 encode the resulting binary data into a text string that is safe to send encoded as ASCII. The receiver will have to reverse this process to recover the original message. This of course requires that the receiver knows which encodings were used, and this information often needs to be sent separately.

Historically it has been used to encode binary data in email messages where the email server might modify line-endings. A more modern example is the use of Base64 encoding to [embed image data directly in HTML source code][4]. Here it is necessary to encode the data to avoid characters like &#39;&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; being interpreted as tags.

---

Here is a working example:

I wish to send a text message with two lines:

&lt;pre&gt;
Hello
world!
&lt;/pre&gt;

If I send it as ASCII (or UTF-8) it will look like this:

    72 101 108 108 111 10 119 111 114 108 100 33

The byte 10 is corrupted in some systems so we can base 64 encode these bytes as a Base64 string:

&lt;pre&gt;SGVsbG8Kd29ybGQh&lt;/pre&gt;

61,"As you say, the &quot;release&quot; process is quite different - in one case (wait) it&#39;s based on `notify()`, the other (join) it&#39;s based on the thread completing. They&#39;re entirely different calls which serve entirely different purposes.

In fact, there are explicit warnings *not* to call `wait()` on `Thread` monitors (although I can&#39;t immediately find those warnings), as internal Java code acquires the locks for them (and uses `wait`/`notify` itself).

But no, calling `join()` on `Thread` *doesn&#39;t* release the monitor if the currently executing thread owns it.

Basically, you shouldn&#39;t think of them as similar at all - one is for waiting for a thread to terminate; the other is for waiting for co-operative coordination.",2012-01-11 13:52:10

```py
def get_result_size(cond1, cond2):
    return df.query(f&quot;{cond1} &amp; {cond2}&quot;).shape[0]
```

Then you can re-write your first example as

```py
data1=get_result_size(&quot;a &gt; 0&quot;, &#39;True&#39;)
data2=get_result_size(&quot;a &gt; 0&quot;, &quot;d==&#39;yes&#39;&quot;)
data3=get_result_size(&quot;a &gt; 0&quot;, &quot;d==&#39;no&#39;&quot;)
```

To produce a table of results, you can write two loops, one within the other. The outer loop loops across your rows. The inner loop loops across the columns.

Note that using query() like this is not very efficient - Pandas is recomputing the same thing many times. For example, the above code evaluates `a &gt; 0` against the entire dataframe 3 times, even though it only needs to be done once. That may be ok for your application, though.",2020-11-16 00:15:48

65,"As @RomanLuštrik says, this is a [hard-coded constraint in bestglm](https://github.com/cran/bestglm/blob/9a9e26a7fc41dcb3049f0a23d31812faea38e8e2/R/bestglm.R#L196), presumably because 15 predictors means there are 2^15 = 32768 candidate models, and one has to stop somewhere ...  as far as I can see there is no way around this constraint when running a GLM. (Roman&#39;s suggestion of `RequireFullEnumerationQ=FALSE` doesn&#39;t work, because the leaps-and-bound algorithm is only available for linear models, not GLMs.)

One possible strategy (not fully explored here) would be to fit the linear model exhaustively with leaps-and-bounds, save a large number of the top models (say `TopModels=1000`) and then re-evaluate the top models with your preferred variance structure ... this doesn&#39;t work directly in `leaps`, but can be hacked as follows:

    leaps.obj &lt;- leaps:::leaps.setup(matrix.xy.16,y=cars.df$mpg,nvmax=16,
           nbest=10000)
    bb &lt;- leaps:::leaps.exhaustive(leaps.obj, really.big=TRUE)

but I don&#39;t know (and it seems like a lot of work) to figure out how to re-evaluate these models with a log-link Gaussian.


You might be able to get the `glmulti` package to work (it offers both `method=&quot;h&quot;` for full enumeration and `method=&quot;g&quot;` for a genetic algorithm), but so far I haven&#39;t managed to overcome some Java errors ...

Unfortunately, the [J Stat Software article describing glmulti](
https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v034i12/v34i12.pdf) shows that this method has some of the same constraints: 

&gt; For  performance,  the Java classes  encode  formulas  as  compact  bit  strings.   Currently  two integers (32 bits each) are used for main effects, and two long integers (128 bits) are used for each  category  of  interaction  terms  (factor:factor,  covariate:covariate,  and  factor:covariate),to encode models.  This means that there can be at most 32 factors and 32 covariates, and, if  including  interactions,  at  most  128  interactions  of  each  category.   The  latter  constraint necessitates that, if x is the number of factors and y the number of covariates:&lt;br&gt;x &lt;16&lt;br&gt;y &lt;16&lt;br&gt;xy &lt;128

6. Close this file
7. Go to your search bar on windows and open **Services** app. Find postgres and restart it.
[picture of services app][1]
8. Write cd.. in cmd and then cd bin. Your path should be `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin`

---

**Update 1:** I&#39;m thinking this is an autoloader problem since the case of &quot;GraphQL&quot; breaks the [default String#camelize used by Rails/Zeitwerk][1]. I prefer &quot;GraphQL&quot; to be lower cased as &quot;graphql&quot; which requires defining a custom inflection.

Cloning your repository, I was able to get it to reliably work with server and spring restarts with the following changes.

1. I renamed `app/graphql/graph_ql_schema.rb` to `app/graphql/graphql_schema.org`
2. I created `config/initializers/zeitwerk.rb` with the contents.

```ruby
Rails.autoloaders.each do |autoloader|
  autoloader.inflector.inflect(
    &quot;graphql_schema&quot; =&gt; &quot;GraphQLSchema&quot;,
  )
end
```

Another solution is to rename the `GraphQLSchema` to satisfy [String#camelize][2]. This is not my preferred solution, but it does work.

1. Rename `GraphQLSchema` to `GraphQlSchema` in `app/graphql/graph_ql_schema.rb`.
2. Rename `GraphQLSchema` to `GraphQlSchema` in `app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb`.

The explanation of why this works can demonstrated with IRB.

86,"The fact is, in JavaScript, there is no such thing as anything++. It does not exist as a command. However, you CAN increment by using ++anything. Try it yourself...

    x=3;
    alert (x);
    Answer is 3.

    x=3;
    x=x++;
    alert (x);
    Answer is 3.
    
    x=3;
    x=++x;
    alert (x);
    Answer is 4.
    
    x=3++;
    alert (x);
    Answer is null.

This proves without a doubt that x++ does not work in this language. People who teach this don&#39;t know the language. In other programming languages x++ DOES increment by 1 but NOT JavaScript. You are better to use this instead:

    x=3;
    x=x+1;
    alert (x);
    Answer is 4.

You don&#39;t want bugs in your code because you type in something that is not a part of the language.

87,"To test something, you need to understand what it does.

`Cooling.__init__` takes two arguments. `c = Cooling(h, Ts)`.

[`__call__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__) should not be called explicitly. It instead lets you call an object like a function: `c(T, t)`. It returns the result of a calculation.

With that in mind, we can write a test to check that it returns what we expect.

You&#39;d also need to test that h, Ts, T, and t are stored correctly. They&#39;re all just copies of the input except `self.T`.

```
class SampleTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_Cooling(self):
        h = 1
        Ts = 2
        T = 3
        t = 4
        newT = -1
        expected = (newT,t)

        cooling = Cooling(h, Ts)
        self.assertEqual( cooling(T,t), expected )
        self.assertEqual( cooling.h, h )
        self.assertEqual( cooling.Ts, Ts )
        self.assertEqual( cooling.t, t )
        self.assertEqual( cooling.T, newT )
```

You&#39;ll have to pick a set of values for h, Ts, T, and t, and do the calculation for `newT` by hand. Or ask who wrote the function for some expected inputs and outputs.

Note that it returns `t` back unaltered, why is it returned at ll?",2020-11-15 22:26:35

89,"The simplest regex for what you are looking for is this: `inet6 ([^ ]+)`.  
It captures every character up until it finds a space.

You should probably use capturing parenthesis to get exactly what you need with the regex instead of replacing what doesn&#39;t match afterwards, it&#39;s cleaner and more readable in my opinion.

91,"`title` is the tag and you can use the [`type`][1] (tag) selector. It is not inside the `script` tag (as shown), e.g. 

`soup.select_one(&#39;title&#39;)`. 

With bs4 4.7.1+ you can use `:contains` to specify has &quot;`Timer`&quot; substring, or longer substring.

e.g. 

    soup.select_one(&#39;title:contains(&quot;Timer&quot;)&#39;)

This assumes the content is not dynamically generated. In that case, you will need to determine if comes from an additional xhr found in the network tab, or the javascript generating it.
